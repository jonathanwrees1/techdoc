            As we have mentioned before, CSS is a language for specifying how
            documents are presented to users — how they are styled, laid out,
            etc. A document is usually a text file structured using a markup
            language — HTML is the most common markup language, but you may also
            come across other markup languages such as SVG or XML. Presenting a
            document to a user means converting it into a form usable by your
            audience. Browsers, like Firefox, Chrome, or Edge , are designed to
            present documents visually, for example, on a computer screen,
            projector, or printer.
          </p>
          <p>
            CSS can be used for very basic document text styling — for example,
            for changing the color and size of headings and links. It can be
            used to create a layout — for example, turning a single column of
            text into a layout with a main content area and a sidebar for
            related information. It can even be used for effects such as
            animation. Have a look at the links in this paragraph for specific
            examples.

            CSS is a rule-based language — you define the rules by specifying
            groups of styles that should be applied to particular elements or
            groups of elements on your web page. For example, you can decide to
            have the main heading on your page to be shown as large red text.
            The following code shows a very simple CSS rule that would achieve
            the styling described above:
          </p>
          <div class="code-example">
            <code>
              h1 {<br />
              color: red;<br />
              font-size: 5em; <br />}
            </code>
          </div>

          <ul>
            <li>
              In the above example, the CSS rule opens with a selector . This
              selects the HTML element that we are going to style. In this case,
              we are styling level one headings (<code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>).
            </li>
            <li>We then have a set of curly braces <code>{}</code>.</li>
            <li>
              Inside the braces will be one or more declarations, which take the
              form of property and value pairs. We specify the property (<code
                >color</code
              >
              in the above example) before the colon, and we specify the value
              of the property after the colon (<code>red</code> in this
              example).
            </li>
            <li>
              This example contains two declarations, one for color and the
              other for font-size. Each pair specifies a property of the
              element(s) we are selecting (<code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> in this
              case), then a value that we'd like to give the property.
            </li>
            <li>I added a list item!</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            CSS properties have different allowable values, depending on which
            property is being specified. In our example, we have the color
            property, which can take various color values. We also have the
            font-size property. This property can take various size units as a
            value. A CSS stylesheet will contain many such rules, written one
            after the other.
          </p>
          <div class="code-example">
            <code>
              h1 {<br />color: red;<br />
              font-size: 5em;<br />
              }<br /><br />
              p {<br />color: black;<br />
              }
            </code>
          </div>
          <p>
            You will find that you quickly learn some values, whereas others you
            will need to look up. The individual property pages on MDN give you
            a quick way to look up properties and their values when you forget
            or when you want to know what else you can use as a value.

            As there are so many things that you could style using CSS, the
            language is broken down into modules. You'll see reference to these
            modules as you explore MDN. Many of the documentation pages are
            organized around a particular module. For example, you could take a
            look at the MDN reference to the Backgrounds and Borders module to
            find out what its purpose is and the properties and features it
            contains. In that module, you will also find a link to
            Specifications that defines the technology (also see the section
            below).
          </p>
          <p>
            At this stage, you don't need to worry too much about how CSS is
            structured; however, it can make it easier to find information if,
            for example, you are aware that a certain property is likely to be
            found among other similar things, and is therefore, probably in the
            same specification.
          </p>
          <p>
            For a specific example, let's go back to the Backgrounds and Borders
            module — you might think that it makes logical sense for the
            <code>background-color</code> and
            <code>border-color</code> properties to be defined in this module.
            And you'd be right.

          <p>
            All web standards technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.) are
            defined in giant documents called specifications (or "specs"), which
            are published by standards organizations (such as the W3C, WHATWG,
            ECMA, or Khronos) and define precisely how those technologies are
            supposed to behave.
          </p>
          <p>
            CSS is no different — it is developed by a group within the W3C
            called the CSS Working Group. This group is made of representatives
            of browser vendors and other companies who have an interest in CSS.
            There are also other people, known as invited experts, who act as
            independent voices; they are not linked to a member organization.
          </p>
          <p>
            New CSS features are developed or specified by the CSS Working Group
            — sometimes because a particular browser is interested in having
            some capability, other times because web designers and developers
            are asking for a feature, and sometimes because the Working Group
            itself has identified a requirement. CSS is constantly developing,
            with new features becoming available. However, a key thing about CSS
            is that everyone works very hard to never change things in a way
            that would break old websites. A website built in 2000, using the
            limited CSS available then, should still be usable in a browser
            today!
          </p>
          <p>
            As a newcomer to CSS, it is likely that you will find the CSS specs
            overwhelming — they are intended for engineers to use to implement
            support for the features in user agents, not for web developers to
            read to understand CSS. Many experienced developers would much
            rather refer to MDN documentation or other tutorials. Nevertheless,
            it is worth knowing that these specs exist and understanding the
            relationship between the CSS you are using, the browser support (see
            below), and the specs.

            After a CSS feature has been specified, then it is only useful for
            us in developing web pages if one or more browsers have implemented
            the feature. This means that the code has been written to turn the
            instruction in our CSS file into something that can be output to the
            screen. We'll look at this process more in the lesson How CSS works.
            It is unusual for all browsers to implement a feature at the same
            time, and so there is usually a gap where you can use some part of
            CSS in some browsers and not in others. For this reason, being able
            to check implementation status is useful.

            understanding of what CSS is, let's move on to Getting started with
            CSS, where you can start to write some CSS yourself.
